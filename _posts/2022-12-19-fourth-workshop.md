Hello Data Citation Community of Practice Participants!

We're sharing an update on our Fourth Data Citation Community of Practice workshop. 
In this workshop we share three use cases on possible approaches to a “reliquary” – a large collection of digital objects used to assist in citation and credit. These use cases come from work by the small team and now ready to share more broadly.

**Data Citation Community of Practice Workshop**

**When:** May 3, 2022

**Workshop Speakers:**

1. Motivation for Community of Practice - Deb Agarwal
2. Initial attempts to create reliquaries for pilot use cases:
* Ameriflux, Deb Agarwal
* German Climate Computing Center/IPCC DCC, Martina Stockhause
* British Oceanographic Data Centre, Justin Buck and James Ayliffe
3. Discussion & Next Steps - Shelley Stall
