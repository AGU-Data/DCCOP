**Hello Data Citation Community of Practice Participants!**  

You are invited to participate in the third workshop of the Community of Practice for Complex Data. This community of practice builds on discussions at the AGU Fall Meeting Data FAIR Town Hall, “Why Is Citing Data Still Hard?”.

In this workshop we share **three use cases on possible approaches to a “reliquary”** – a large collection of digital objects used to assist in citation and credit. These use cases come from work by the small team and now ready to share more broadly.

**Title:** Data Citation Community of Practice (Third) Workshop  
**When:** October 29, 2021 11:00 AM Eastern Time (15:00 UTC)
