Have you been following along with the work of our Data Citation Community of Practice?

**Workshops**
Our workshops have explored three use cases on possible approaches to the use of a "reliquary" - a large collection of digital objects used to assist in citation and credit.
You can check out the workshop materials on Zenodo - see our previous posts for links!
